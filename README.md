📊 Task 2: Data Analysis and Exploration
This project focuses on analyzing and exploring the Titanic dataset using Python in Visual Studio Code (VS Code). The goal is to understand the data, identify patterns, and gain insights about the factors affecting passenger survival.

📌 Objectives
Load and inspect the Titanic dataset

Clean and preprocess data (handle missing values, encode categorical data)

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Visualize key features affecting survival

Draw basic insights and observations

🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python 3.x

VS Code

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Seaborn

Jupyter Notebook

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights
Survival Rates by gender, age, class

Missing Values analysis and treatment

Correlation Heatmap to understand relationships

Bar plots, histograms, pie charts to visualize distributions and patterns

📈 Key Insights
Females had a higher survival rate than males

Passengers in first class had a better chance of survival

Children (age < 10) were more likely to survive

Fare and embarkation point had moderate influence
